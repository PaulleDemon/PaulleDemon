As the name suggest this was indeed created because I was feeling lonely. It was frustrating not being able to find someone whom I could trust to tell things that I always wanted to. I was afraid that if I would speak my mind, it would spread like wild fire. Its important that you speak out your mind atleast once in a while, without having to worry about what other people would think of you or would you be taunted for a message you sent 5-10 years ago. 

on 11th July eve, I was out on a walk; very angry due, to the fact that I was not able to share things to people and it was frustrating. Thats when an idea struck, I could make a completely anonymous platform where, not just me, but you and everone could share things they always wanted to, without being taunted for it after 5-10 years from now.

It was supposed to be called only loners, but then I was so facinated by the Thomas Shelby clips on Youtube that I decide to add the word mafia at the end. The bunny icon was inspired from the PlayBoy logo. To Build this I took out a week long break from my college, which indded made many professors angry and disappointed. Working on this project was indeed painful as there is always college in my way to stop me. Which is why I consider college is a waste of time.
