## AdoStrings - [source code](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/AdoStrings-support)

Ever found yourself in an orginazation and not knowing to contact the right set of people for the job, or been in an university and finding it hard to find people with similar interests? Well AdoStrings is just made to help you find people. AdoStrings is an open-sourced private networks for colleges and orginazation. Users within an orginazation or university can write stories, make requests that will be notified to the right set of people, and notify upcoming events.

This was done as part of our final semester project. Me and my team mate Manas Sharma, were brainstorming ideas, for the final year project, considering the fact that we were coming towards the end of college life, we decided to make something that would make an impact within our college. Our college has multiple canteens, many of which are crowed, So the first idea we had was to create a crowd control application for canteen, the basic idea was to use computer vision or heat maps and notify students and staff of the least crowed canteen in the campus we had also planned on adding budget, to help students make maximum out of the minimum. We didn't find this idea interesting enough or not truely a memorable idea for which we could be remembered.

We then decided to rate people based on peoples talent. So we go pitch this idea to one of our professor, who was impressed by the idea that she wanted a lot more than just rating people, she also wanted us to include aluminis (which we decided not to include), show graphs on which departments has the most talent in a specific skill etc. So to account for all this and more we invent the stories section, a section where people get to post their day-to-day stories in the campus, share their thoughts, ideas and opinions, notify events hapenning within the campus and ask for requests and more.

Finding people using this application got much simpler using the search or the peoples tab in the sidebar. Finding a name was quite a hassle, the strings was inspired from a cob web that I saw during a morning walk, the strings ment network. The first name we were going for was CStrings, the c was named after our college, as well as "college" itself. But, unfortunately as the domain was already taken we decide to go with other names such as IStrings, GStrings, HStrings, CStingsz, stringszz. But non of them made much sense as it inherently didn't carry any meaning. So my teammate suggests vibestrings, but vibe was overly used, so we started looking for synonyms of vibe, while we did find many other synonyms ado was short hence we looked up for its meaning, turns out it was a french word that translated to teenage in English. Fast-forwards to the end, we had two names adochords and adostrings, after a round of votes from people we know, we decided to go with adostrings.

TLDR - we created a network for college that helps people find people

(The important idea on how we came up with this project idea is purposefully omitted, if you want to know the complete picture ask Paul personally don't force anyone else on the team)


## LonersMafia - [lonersmafia.com](lonersmafia.com) 

**source code for this project**: [source code](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/LonersMafia-support#source-code)

As the name suggest this was indeed created because I was feeling lonely. It was frustrating not being able to find someone whom I could trust to tell things that I always wanted to. I was afraid that if I would speak my mind to someone, 10 other people would get to know. Its important that we speak out your mind atleast once in a while, without having to worry about what other people would think of you or without being taunted for a message you shared 5-10 years ago. 

on 11th July eve, I was out on a walk; very angry due, to the fact that I was not able to share things to people and it was frustrating. Thats when an idea struck, I would make a completely anonymous platform where, not just me, but you and everone could share things they always wanted to, without being taunted for it after 5-10 years from now.  

Initially, when I made this the users didn't have to log back in or enter a password as it would automatically log you in based on your IP address. Well you could see the problem with this couldn't you? Yes as you would have guessed the IP address keeps changing and getting resassigned. It was only on 26th of July when I thought the project was complete, I got to know that the IP gets reassigned everytime you connect to the network. 

So I tried researching on other ways of logging users in without password, looking for something unqiue in each device. After searching for for 3 days, the only thing I came across was browser fingerprinting, so I decided to fall back to password login.  

It was supposed to be called only loners, but then I was so facinated by the Thomas Shelby clips on Youtube that I decide to add the word mafia at the end. 

To Build this I took out a week long break from my college, which didn't go well with my professors. Working on this project was indeed painful as there is always college in my way to stop me. I consider attending college classes a waste of time ðŸ¤ª. 



## [Python designer](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/PythonDesigner)

The python designer is a visual scripting tool that I created. This simplified the process of writing code, it easily helps you visualize and create connections to represent inheritance and other relations. Once you have created the nodes and relations you can easily click on generate button on the menubar and generate the python code. The user can also save the visual script and load it again later using the save button. Undo and redo functionality was also implemented in this project.

This project was inspired from Blender software's shader editor/node editor, which simplified the process of applying materials on objects. The first version that I created took me around 3 months, so I took a break, then restarted the project from scratch which then took me close to 1(1/2) months. As I progressed I realized that this project was too complex for one person. So I decided to remove many features that I wanted to add inorder to complete the project. The experience from this project would paved way for a lot of softwares and programs that I wrote after that.


## [RoboticArmController](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/RoboticArmController)

I created this as my end-semester project for my 5 sem. I designed and created a robotic arm to help reduce the complexity involved in controlling a robotic arm in the manufacturing industry. This was inspired by when I found how complex it was to operate a robotic Arm. They had a thick manual on how to operate and many codes. It becomes expensive to train your people and to ask for support from the manufacturer, as every robot uses its own programming language. To simplify this, I created a simple interface to easily operate robotic arm without typing any code.

The instructions are executed sequentially and the current instruction being executed is highlighted.


## [tkTimePicker](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/tkTimePicker)

This was the first library that I published to PyPi and the one I was very proud of at that time. As the name sounds it is indeed a time picker, and it is made for tkinter python framework. The framework itself doesn't come with many widgets, so I created this time picker to make other people's life easier. This widget allows users to easily customize and comes with analog, modern, and spin time pickers.  The inspiration came from andriod analog alarm clock. I wanted a good looking timepicker so I created one for everyone. 


## [tkVideoPlayer](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/tkVideoPlayer)

I was a daily StackOverflow contributor. When I was browsing through StackOverflow I noticed that quite a number of people were asking how to create a video player using tkinter. I then looked up if there were any libraries made for tkinter to play videos, I didn't find many. The one's that I found were quite hard for beginners to use. So I decided to create a video player widget for tkinter. With each version the library got better and currently. One of the thing that excites me even more about this project is that a complete stranger made a video and wrote a blog on how to use this library.


## [tkStyleSheet](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/tkStyleSheet)

tkstylesheet is another library that I created to make it easier for styling tkinter application. I was so impressed by convience of qss, stylesheet made for PyQt framework; that I decided to make one for tkinter framework, since it did have any. The stylesheet allowed seperating of styles to anyther file improving readability and maintainability of the code by a great amount.


## [pyCollision](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/PyCollision)

This library was created as a result of the problem that I faced while making a Tank Game using PyGame. At that time I wasn't aware that pygame had a way to detect pixel perfect collision by using `pygame.mask.from_surface()` and `pygame.sprite.collide_mask()`. So I started on journey to create one, which was flexible enough to control the precision of the collision and yet fast enough. The basic idea of collision was to draw a reatangle of given width and height by the user on a PNG transparent image. I then remove the rectangles over completely transparent parts of the image. The rectangles are stored in a numpy array, and when ever another a vertex or an edge of the another rectangle intersect, it alerts a collision.

## [Hunter2](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/Hunter2)

I always wanted to make a game by myself and play it. So this was the game I created by myself includng all the illustrations and icons. The games difficult increases dramatically with time. This was the time when I properly understood what normalization ment. The collision problem in this game is what lead me to creat PyCollision library.


## [SHome](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/SHomes)

This was my 6th semeter IOT project that I had taken up. I took up this project to improvise on my idea that I hade presented on engineers day in my first year. This is a smart home software makes use of facial recognition and changes the room ambience according to the person in the room.
The user can easily register and preset the users desired ambience and vola! the room ambience changes automatically.


## [Music App](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/MusicApp)

I took up this project to take a break from PythonDesigner. This is a aesthetically pleasing desktop music player that loads musics from your local computer. The player also provides statics on what songs you listen the most, search songs, ability to add songs to your favorites or collections.


**While there are many other projects that I wrote, I couldn't write the stories each of them here. So I leave it here. Thank you for reading.**
