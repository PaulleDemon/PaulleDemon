### The stories and inspiration behind every piece of software.

## LonersMafia - [lonersmafia.com](lonersmafia.com) 

As the name suggest this was indeed created because I was feeling lonely. It was frustrating not being able to find someone whom I could trust to tell things that I always wanted to. I was afraid that if I would speak my mind, it would spread like wild fire. Its important that you speak out your mind atleast once in a while, without having to worry about what other people would think of you or would you be taunted for a message you sent 5-10 years ago. 

on 11th July eve, I was out on a walk; very angry due, to the fact that I was not able to share things to people and it was frustrating. Thats when an idea struck, I could make a completely anonymous platform where, not just me, but you and everone could share things they always wanted to, without being taunted for it after 5-10 years from now.

It was supposed to be called only loners, but then I was so facinated by the Thomas Shelby clips on Youtube that I decide to add the word mafia at the end. The bunny icon was inspired from the PlayBoy logo. To Build this I took out a week long break from my college, which indded made many professors angry and disappointed. Working on this project was indeed painful as there is always college in my way to stop me. Which is why I consider college is a waste of time. 



## [Python designer](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/PythonDesigner)

The python designer is a visual scripting tool that I created. This simplified the process of writing code, it easily helps you visualize and create connections to represent inheritance and other relations. Once you have created the nodes and relations you can easily click on generate button on the menubar and generate the python code. The user can also save the visual script and load it again later using the save button. Undo and redo functionality was also implemented in this project.

This project was inspired from Blender software's shader editor/node editor, which simplified the process of applying materials on objects. The first version that I created took me around 3 months, so I took a break, then restarted the project from scratch which then took me close to 1(1/2) months. As I progressed I realized that this project was too complex for one person. So I decided to remove many features that I wanted to add inorder to complete the project. The experience from this project would paved way for a lot of softwares and programs that I wrote after that.
