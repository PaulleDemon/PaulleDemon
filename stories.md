### The stories and inspiration behind every piece of software.

## LonersMafia - [lonersmafia.com](lonersmafia.com) 

As the name suggest this was indeed created because I was feeling lonely. It was frustrating not being able to find someone whom I could trust to tell things that I always wanted to. I was afraid that if I would speak my mind, it would spread like wild fire. Its important that you speak out your mind atleast once in a while, without having to worry about what other people would think of you or would you be taunted for a message you sent 5-10 years ago. 

on 11th July eve, I was out on a walk; very angry due, to the fact that I was not able to share things to people and it was frustrating. Thats when an idea struck, I could make a completely anonymous platform where, not just me, but you and everone could share things they always wanted to, without being taunted for it after 5-10 years from now.

It was supposed to be called only loners, but then I was so facinated by the Thomas Shelby clips on Youtube that I decide to add the word mafia at the end. The bunny icon was inspired from the PlayBoy logo. To Build this I took out a week long break from my college, which indded made many professors angry and disappointed. Working on this project was indeed painful as there is always college in my way to stop me. Which is why I consider college is a waste of time. 



## [Python designer](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/PythonDesigner)

The python designer is a visual scripting tool that I created. This simplified the process of writing code, it easily helps you visualize and create connections to represent inheritance and other relations. Once you have created the nodes and relations you can easily click on generate button on the menubar and generate the python code. The user can also save the visual script and load it again later using the save button. Undo and redo functionality was also implemented in this project.

This project was inspired from Blender software's shader editor/node editor, which simplified the process of applying materials on objects. The first version that I created took me around 3 months, so I took a break, then restarted the project from scratch which then took me close to 1(1/2) months. As I progressed I realized that this project was too complex for one person. So I decided to remove many features that I wanted to add inorder to complete the project. The experience from this project would paved way for a lot of softwares and programs that I wrote after that.


## [RoboticArmController](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/RoboticArmController)

I created this as my end-semester project for my 5 sem. I designed and created a robotic arm to help reduce the complexity involved in controlling a robotic arm in the manufacturing industry. This was inspired by when I found how complex it was to operate a robotic Arm. They had a thick manual on how to operate and many codes. It becomes expensive to train your people and to ask for support from the manufacturer, as every robot uses its own programming language. To simplify this, I created a simple interface to easily operate robotic arm without typing any code.

The instructions are executed sequentially and the current instruction being executed is highlighted.


## [tkTimePicker](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/tkTimePicker)

This was the first library that I published to PyPi and the one I was very proud of at that time. As the name sounds it is indeed a time picker, and it is made for tkinter python framework. The framework itself doesn't come with many widgets, so I created this time picker to make other people's life easier. This widget allows users to easily customize and comes with analog, modern, and spin time pickers.  The inspiration came from andriod analog alarm clock. I wanted a good looking timepicker so I created one for everyone. 


## [tkVideoPlayer](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/tkVideoPlayer)

I was a daily StackOverflow contributor. When I was browsing through StackOverflow I noticed that quite a number of people were asking how to create a video player using tkinter. I then looked up if there were any libraries made for tkinter to play videos, I didn't find many. The one's that I found were quite hard for beginners to use. So I decided to create a video player widget for tkinter. With each version the library got better and currently. One of the thing that excites me even more about this project is that a complete stranger made a video and wrote a blog on how to use this library.


## [tkStyleSheet](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/tkStyleSheet)

tkstylesheet is another library that I created to make it easier for styling tkinter application. I was so impressed by convience of qss, stylesheet made for PyQt framework; that I decided to make one for tkinter framework, since it did have any. The stylesheet allowed seperating of styles to anyther file improving readability and maintainability of the code by a great amount.


## [pyCollision](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/PyCollision)

This library was created as a result of the problem that I faced while making a Tank Game using PyGame. At that time I wasn't aware that pygame had a way to detect pixel perfect collision by using `pygame.mask.from_surface()` and `pygame.sprite.collide_mask()`. So I started on journey to create one, which was flexible enough to control the precision of the collision and yet fast enough. The basic idea of collision was to draw a reatangle of given width and height by the user on a PNG transparent image. I then remove the rectangles over completely transparent parts of the image. The rectangles are stored in a numpy array, and when ever another a vertex or an edge of the another rectangle intersect, it alerts a collision.

## [Hunter2](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/Hunter2)

I always wanted to make a game by myself and play it. So this was the game I created by myself includng all the illustrations and icons. The games difficult increases dramatically with time. This was the time when I properly understood what normalization ment. The collision problem in this game is what lead me to creat PyCollision library.


## [SHome](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/SHomes)

This was my 6th semeter IOT project that I had taken up. I took up this project to improvise on my idea that I hade presented on engineers day in my first year. This is a smart home software makes use of facial recognition and changes the room ambience according to the person in the room.
The user can easily register and preset the users desired ambience and vola! the room ambience changes automatically.


## [Music App](https://github.com/PaulleDemon/MusicApp)

I took up this project to take a break from PythonDesigner. This is a aesthetically pleasing desktop music player that loads musics from your local computer. The player also provides statics on what songs you listen the most, search songs, ability to add songs to your favorites or collections.


While there are many other projects that I wrote, I couldn't write the stories each of them here. So I leave it here. Thank you for reading.
